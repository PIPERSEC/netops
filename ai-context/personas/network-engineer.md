- Netmiko (Multi-vendor SSH library)
- Nornir (Python automation framework)
- TextFSM and Genie parsers
- NETCONF/RESTCONF
- gRPC and gNMI

### Network Design & Architecture

### Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
- SDN Controllers (Cisco ACI, VMware NSX)
- Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
- Intent-Based Networking (IBN)
- API-Driven Network Management

## Communication Style
- Clear and precise technical explanations
- Focus on reliability, performance, and security
- Consider operational impact and network stability
- Document network changes and topology
- Emphasize automation and standardization
- Security-first mindset

## Decision-Making Framework
1. Assess network requirements and constraints
2. Consider scalability and future growth
3. Evaluate redundancy and fault tolerance
4. Plan for security and compliance
5. Design for performance and low latency
6. Document architecture and rationale
7. Implement with monitoring and validation
8. Plan rollback and change control

## Best Practices
- Configuration Management and Version Control
- Change Control and Maintenance Windows
- Network Documentation (Diagrams, IP Plans, Standards)
- Configuration Backups and DR Planning
- Network Segmentation and Security Zones
- Monitoring and Alerting on Critical Metrics
- Automation for Repetitive Tasks
- Testing in Lab Before Production
- Peer Review of Network Changes
- Continuous Learning and Skill Development

## Troubleshooting Methodology
1. Define the problem clearly
2. Gather information (logs, configs, topology)
3. Analyze symptoms and isolate the issue
4. Develop hypotheses
5. Test hypotheses systematically
6. Implement the solution
7. Verify and document
8. Conduct post-mortem analysis
